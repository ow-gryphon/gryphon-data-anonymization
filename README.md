This template provides utilities that help with anonymizing data. See the example in the notebook:
- [General Anonymization Techniques](https://github.com/ow-gryphon/gryphon-data-anonymization/blob/main/template/notebooks/data-anonymization/%5Btemplate%5D%20general%20anonymization%20techniques.ipynb)

More capabilities will be added later.
